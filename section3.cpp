question2:
When we use while loop, it checks the condition first, then executes the body.
Do-while loop, at least once the body is executed, then condition is checked.

question3:
Switch statement is used to compare the value of variable with other values.
The role of "case" gives the specific value to compare the original value.
The role of "break" stops the switch block. The role of "default" can simply said that
it works when any case does not match.
