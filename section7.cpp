question2:
When using enums instead of string or integer constants, only clearly defined values are used,
protects against sending incorrect strings.

question3:
It is impossible to give an incorrect value.

 question4:
C++ scoped enum: strong type safety, but no methods or fields.
Java enum: similar to an object-methods, fields, and constructors can be added.
