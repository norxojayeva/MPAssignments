question2:
Well, I think there is no much difference between them. Primitive types stores simple values like
integer, double, boolean, char. And their values are directly stored on stack.
Reference types, their address is on stack but object itself is on heap.

question3:
Scope refers to the context of the code, where is can be used, where it can be accessed.
When the scope is inside the function or method, it is called local scope and it can be accessed
only inside that function/method. But when it is declared outside of the functions/methods (inside the class)
then it's called class-level scope, and we can use it wherever we want in the method or function.

 question4:
Both C++ and Java are statically-typed languages. That means, if we declare
int a=7, it is 7 always, we cannot make a=9 or some kind of value. And during run time,
it helps with finding errors, rather than dynamic-typed.
