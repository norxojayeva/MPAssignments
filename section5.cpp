question2:
Comments are helpful with understanding the code. Especially, when working with the team,

Documentation comment systems like Javadoc for Java and Doxygen for C++ are used to generate
structured, readable documentation directly from source code comments itself.
They help to explain classes, methods, return values and other things clearly.

 question4:
The philosophy “Good code is self-documenting” means that code that we have written should be clear,
readable, and well-structured so that its purpose is obvious, not always rely on comments.
Using meaningful variable names, consistent formatting, and clean logic makes code easier to understand.
