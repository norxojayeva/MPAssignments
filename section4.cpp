question2:
In C++, arguments can be passed by value, in that  case a copy is passed, or 2nd way, by reference
the original variable is directly accessed using pointers.
In Java, all arguments are passed by value.

question3:
Function/Method overloading lets multiple functions with the same name but different parameter
lists in the same scope.
In C++, and in Java, the functions must differ in the number, type, or order of parameters,
the return type alone cannot be used to identify them.

 question4:
Recursion function is the function that calls itself repeatedly. The base case is the condition
that stops the recursion. If the base case is not given, recursion calls itself endlessly.
