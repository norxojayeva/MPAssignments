question2:
A class is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of something,
such as its attributes and methods.
An object is a specific realization of a class, it is created in memory, with its
own values for the defined attributes.

question3:
The public access specifier, we can use it anywhere in the code, meanwhile private
can only be used inside the class. Protected is also somehow like private, it can be used
inside the class or inherited classes.

 question4:
Constructor is a method that is automatically called when an object is created,
providing it with an initial value. Default constructor is also a method but without
any parameter. Constructor is automatically added when it is not written in the program.
