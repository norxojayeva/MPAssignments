question2:
The primary purpose of the main function is being called when the program runs,
because it is considered as entry point.
Main function is declared static in java language, because if it not static, we should create
an object that needs again main function to call.

question3:
In C++, main function returns integer, and it has number of arguments and
 array of arguments as parameters. Meanwhile, in java, function returns nothing, and it has array of
 arguments as parameter.

 question4:
 In C++, when it returns integer or 0, it means program run successfully.
 In Java, it does not return a value, if non-zero exit happens it means there is an error.
